# Type System Discipline

The type checker is a proof assistant. Use it to eliminate impossible states, mismatched primitives, and unhandled variants at compile time. A case the types let you ignore becomes a runtime failure the compiler could have stopped. Prefer defining errors and special cases out of existence over proliferating handlers; unrepresentable states, total functions, and interface redesign (the patterns below) are the tools.

Apply proportionally in any typed language. Prefer the simplest representation that enforces an actual invariant without spreading ceremony through unrelated callers.

**The patterns:**

- **Make illegal states unrepresentable.** Model variants as sum types: discriminated unions in TypeScript, enums with payloads in Rust/Swift/Kotlin, sealed classes in Scala, ADTs in Haskell/OCaml. Don't model state as a bag of optional fields where contradictory combinations compile. A subtle anti-pattern worth naming: `{ completed: boolean; completedAt?: Date }` admits `completed: true; completedAt: undefined`, which is meaningless. Derive the boolean from a single source like `completedAt !== null`, or model the variants explicitly as `{ kind: 'open' } | { kind: 'done'; at: Date }`. If a bug forces the question "wait, can this combination actually happen?", the type is too loose.
- **Types are constructions, not restrictions.** Build the type up from the values you want instead of carving them out of a looser type with checks. The invariant that seems to need a refinement type is usually a construction away. A non-empty list is a head plus a rest, not a list with a length check. A valid time range is a start plus a duration, not two timestamps you must keep ordered. No representation is privileged. A list of pairs is an even-length list if you interpret it that way, so choose the shape that cannot build the illegal value and expose the interface callers need on top.
- **Distinguish semantic primitives when confusion is plausible.** `UserId` and `OrderId` may both be strings but should not be interchangeable across meaningful domain boundaries. Use the language's lightweight nominal mechanism when it prevents a demonstrated class of mix-up; do not brand every primitive by reflex.
- **Treat external data as untrusted until parsed.** Validate RPC payloads, JSON, IPC messages, CLI args, configuration, environment variables, and other external input at the boundary that owns the contract. Avoid repeating validation inside trusted code.
- **Minimize unchecked coercion.** Prefer validation, narrowing, or a better model. A small bridge cast is acceptable after runtime validation or where a framework boundary cannot express a fact; keep it local and test the boundary.
- **Exhaustive matching is the compiler's job.** When you match on a sum type, the compiler must fail compilation if a new variant is added without handling. Use the idiom your language provides: `never`-typed binding in TypeScript, unannotated `match` in Rust, `-Wincomplete-patterns` in Haskell, sealed-class match exhaustiveness in Kotlin.
- **Derive types from authoritative schemas.** When a protocol buffer, OpenAPI spec, GraphQL schema, database migration, or design-system token file defines a shape, derive from it instead of hand-rolling a parallel type. Manual duplication drifts.
- **Strengthen a type only where partiality appears.** A runtime assertion, null check, or "this should never happen" throw marks the place a type is too weak. Push that check up into the type. Then stop. The type system's job is to track the cases each use site must handle, not to describe the data as precisely as possible. Prefer total functions. `sum` of an empty list is 0, so it takes the plain list. `head` of an empty list has no answer, so it demands the non-empty one. Extra precision costs reuse and ceremony and buys no safety.

**The tests:**

- "Can I write a comment explaining when this combination of fields is valid?" If yes, the type is too loose. Split it into a sum type.
- "Could two same-shaped values be mixed up at a real boundary?" If yes, consider a nominal type or object parameter.
- "Where did this `any`, this cast, or this assertion come from?" Trace it to the boundary, validate when possible, and isolate any unavoidable bridge.
- "If a new variant is added next month, will the compiler tell the next agent where to add a case?" If no, the match isn't exhaustive.
- "Is this type duplicating a shape another file owns?" Derive instead.
- "Am I strengthening this type to keep an operation total, or just to be more precise?" If nothing would otherwise panic, keep the plain type.
