# Pull Request Guidelines

**NEVER** add the "Generated with Droid" footer or any branding/signature to pull request descriptions. Keep PR bodies clean and focused on the content only.

## Rules

- Do NOT add "Generated with [Droid](...)" or similar footers
- Do NOT add AI attribution or branding to PRs
- Keep PR body focused on: summary, test plan, and relevant context only
- Use HEREDOC for PR body to ensure clean formatting
