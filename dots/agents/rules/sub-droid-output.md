# Sub-Droid Output Handling

When using the Task tool to launch sub-droids (Explore, Code, Plan, etc.), you MUST present the complete, verbose output from the sub-droid to the user WITHOUT summarizing it.

## Rules

1. After a sub-droid completes its task, show the FULL output to the user
2. Do NOT create concise summaries of sub-droid results
3. Do NOT condense or paraphrase the sub-droid's findings
4. Present the complete response as returned by the sub-droid
5. You may add brief context (e.g., "Here's what the droid found:") but then show the full output

The user prefers to see all details and findings from sub-droids directly.
